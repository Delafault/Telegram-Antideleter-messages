6. Next, you will have the created application page open, where you will have to copy the api_id and api_hash of the application.

7. Go to our folder with the file "main.py", open cmd there and write: "pip install -r requirements.txt".

8. That's it! Now run the script itself via cmd: "python main.py" and then fill in all the necessary data.

(This is roughly what it looks like in action)
In any case, if you are not satisfied or do not like something, you can always customize the script to suit you.

--- If you want to change the account, go to the created "config.ini" file and delete everything there or delete the file itself or delete only what you need in the file itself --
